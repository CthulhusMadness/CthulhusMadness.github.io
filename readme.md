## __About me__
Hi, I am Michele Santoni. Iâ€™m 23 years old and I live in Arezzo, Italy.
I finished the Event Horizon's Game Programming Course at TheSign Comics & Arts Academy in Florence. 

I am a reliable, motivated and honest worker with good comunication skills and a great passion for video-games, which is the main reason why I decided to start this journey into Game Development.

My favorite branch game of programming is Gameplay Programming, followed by Tools and UI.
